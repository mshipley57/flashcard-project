                  <h2>Javascript</h2>
                  <p>an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers</p>

                  <h2>Operators</h2>
                  <p>a symbol or function denoting an operation</p>

                  <h2>Variables</h2>
                  <p>a data item that may take on more than one value during the runtime of a program.</p>

                  <h2>Variable naming conventions</h2>
                  <p>e.g. camelCase: a typographical convention in which an initial capital is used for the first letter of a word forming the second element of a closed compound</p>

                  <h2>Functions</h2>
                  <p>a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.</p>

                  <h2>Methods</h2>
                  <p>Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods</p>

                  <h2>Arguments</h2>
                  <p>a value that is passed between programs, subroutines or functions. Arguments are independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes. When an argument is used to customize a program for a user, it is typically called a "parameter."</p>

                  <h2>Parameters</h2>
                  <p>a parameter (often called formal parameter or formal argument) is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine</p>

                  <h2>Return</h2>
                  <p>The return statement terminates the execution of a function and returns control to the calling function. A return statement can also return a value to the calling function.</p>

                  <h2>Chaining methods</h2>
                  <p> also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                  <h2>Strings</h2>
                  <p>a string is any finite sequence of characters (i.e., letters, numerals, symbols and punctuation marks). An important characteristic of each string is its length, which is the number of characters in it. The length can be any natural number (i.e., zero or any positive integer).</p>

                  <h2>Boolean</h2>
                  <p>a binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false.”</p>

                  <h2>Undefined</h2>
                  <p>a condition where an expression does not have a correct value, although it is syntactically correct. An undefined value must not be confused with empty string, boolean "false" or other "empty" (but defined) values.</p>

                  <h2>NaN</h2>
                  <p>standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations.</p>

                  <h2>Escape</h2>
                  <p>used for any of various functions, as to interrupt or cancel the current process or running program, or to close a pop-up window. Expand.</p>

                  <h2>Alert</h2>
                  <p>The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.</p>

                  <h2>Comments</h2>
                  <p>To create a single line comment in JavaScript, you place two slashes "//" in front of the code or text you wish to have the JavaScript interpreter ignore. When you place these two slashes, all text to the right of them will be ignored, until the next line.</p>

                  <h2>jQuery</h2>
                  <p>jQuery is a concise and fast JavaScript library that can be used to simplify event handling, HTML document traversing, Ajax interactions and animation for speedy website development. jQuery simplifies the HTML's client-side scripting, thus simplifying Web 2.0 applications development.</p>

                  <h2>Attributes</h2>
                  <p>The attributes property returns a collection of the specified node's attributes, as a NamedNodeMap object.</p>
